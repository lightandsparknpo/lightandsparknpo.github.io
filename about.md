Light & Spark NPO is a non-profit educational initiative event that aims at teaching IT/Computer-Science students industry-relevant technologies like WordPress, Microsoft Azure, Agile Scrum, Google Analytics and much more, and also help them build a website for an NGO/Non-Profit over a period of 2 days.

## For Students

For students, these 2-days will be a learning experience that will be guided by our 4 capable mentors and an overall mentor. Students will learn by doing things practically in a simulated work-like environment consisting of other team members (students whom they might have not met before), a design team, the client representatives (in this case, the participating NGO) and their mentor.

## For NGO’s

For NGO’s/charities, this event will help them get an online presence and various other technological benefits offered by non-profit programs, and thus, allow them to excel in the field they have been working tirelessly in and reach out to as many people possible.

## For Mentors

As much as the mentors are excited to share their knowledge with other budding IT professionals, they are also learning a lot by challenging themselves to learn and teach these concepts in a way that the students understand better. These 2-days also add a lot of experience & exposure to each mentors’ CV not only because of their technical contribution but also the efforts they have put in to ensure that the event runs smoothly.
