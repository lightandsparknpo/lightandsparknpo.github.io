We’d love to partner with NGO’s, non-profits or charities who are actively working towards making the community a better space but do not have an online presence.

Our aim is to give back to the community. We do that by teaching IT students technological concepts that are currently used in the industry by giving them a practical exposure over the 2-day event. We also share this experience and offer our services towards the community by developing and delivering a website (and much more) for 2-4 NGO’s/non-profits (per event) so that they can continue doing the good deeds and now create a bigger impact.

If you’re interested, please [get in touch with us](/contact).
