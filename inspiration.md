## Inspiration behind Light & Spark NPO

Having studied and worked in Auckland, New Zealand, the founder and mentor of this event, [Clyde D’Souza](https://clydedsouza.net/), has closely observed the differences in the way things are taught, the opportunities available, the working culture, the expectations set and much more. He is inspired to bring back some of his personal experiences and give back to the community by creating an opportunity for students to learn and grow, creating a platform for mentors to teach and gain a new experience, and provide an online presence for NGO’s at absolutely no cost*, so that they can create a bigger impact in the area they’ve been working tirelessly in.

## Meaning behind the brand name

The name Light & Spark NPO breaks down into 2 parts – _light_ symbolizes the knowledge we’re providing the students and _spark_ symbolizes the change we’re bringing for the participating NGO’s/non-profits/charities. Light & Spark’s events runs on a completely not-for-profit basis hence the _NPO_ suffixed at the end.

_* At no service cost. Third party fees might be applicable. Any activity outside of the event will be chargeable._
